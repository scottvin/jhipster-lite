  # In Gradle, you can centralize common configuration options in the `gradle.properties` file or
  # within the `build.gradle` scripts. This ensures consistency when running Gradle tasks either from the command line or in CI environments.
  # Options like `--no-daemon` and `--quiet` are command-line specific. `--no-daemon` is useful in CI environments to avoid background processes,
  # and `--quiet` reduces output verbosity, showing only errors.
