# Live reload setup

This project uses NPM and spring-boot-devtools module to have live reloading.

Use the following steps to get it working:

1. Run the Spring Boot application with the `default` profile: `./mvnw`
2. From a terminal, run `npm run build && npm run watch` (You can also run `npm run --silent build && npm run --silent watch` if you want less output in the terminal)
3. Your default browser will open at http://localhost:3000

You should now be able to change any HTML or CSS and have the browser reload upon saving the file.

NOTE: If you use a separate authentication server (e.g., social logins, or Keycloak) then after login,
you might get redirected to http://localhost:{{serverPort}} as opposed to http://localhost:3000.
Be sure to set the port back to `3000` in your browser to have live reload.
